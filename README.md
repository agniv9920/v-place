# v-place
All Universities placements/internships in one place are organised, categorised, easy to find and easy to apply.
During the placement season, the university gives emails to apply for the placement drive of each and every company. Due to this, the inbox gets dumped with so many emails including the regular curriculum
updates. Hence, this is a hectic job for the university and students to maintain all these emails on time. Therefore we came up with the idea of keeping all the placement-related updates in one place.
This encouraged us to think of VPlace which is an optimized website for viewing all the companies visiting the university for the placement drive. Even the university has to push all the placement details of all companies once
thereby reducing the frequency of emails and easily providing updates to the students. The website will maintain all the records of placements and the students registering for the companies in a database which will be easily fetched by
the servers. We hope that the website will reduce the problems faced by both the students and the university thereby saving so much precious time because time is valued more than money.
